# Secretmessaging
Messaging application for Android, which uses cryptographic techniques to increase the security of communication.

This is my Master's degree thesis project. 

In short it uses the cryptographic technique of secret sharing to encrypt a message string, which outputs n "shares". 
These shares can only be decrypted if all shares are present. Each share is sent over a different social networking "channel",currently via Twitter and Gmail. 

The purpose of this is to obfsucate the communication between two people, and not allowing malicious individuals, rogue employees or surveilling governments to access your communication.
